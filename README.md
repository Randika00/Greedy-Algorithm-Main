## Greedy-Algorithm-Main

In the hopes of arriving at the global optimal solution, we follow the decision that appears most advantageous at the time while using a greedy
algorithm. For the purpose of calculating the best solution, we make decisions in dynamic programming at each stage by taking into account the present problem and the answer to a subproblem that has already been addressed.
