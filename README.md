 ## Greedy-Algorithm-Main

In the hopes of arriving at the global optimal solution, we follow the decision that appears most advantageous at the time while using a greedy
algorithm. For the purpose of calculating the best solution, we make decisions in dynamic programming at each stage by taking into account the
present problem and the answer to a subproblem that has already been addressed.The greedy method's primary benefit is its simplicity in both 
application and comprehension. It can, however, be very sluggish and is not always guaranteed to discover the optimum option. In order to discover
the global optimum, the greedy technique operates by selecting the option that is locally optimal at each stage.
